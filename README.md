# HANGMAN GAME

## Introuction
This is another implementation of the popular game, Hangman.

This version uses Python as primary language to implement this game.

The data is taken from a list of 3000 most common used word. This can be further checked out [here](https://www.ef.edu/english-resources/english-vocabulary/top-3000-words/).

The game currently is in text-based. I'm looking further to expand it into GUI, and maybe implement it in another language, such as **Java**.
